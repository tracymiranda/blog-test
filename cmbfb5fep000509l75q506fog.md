We are excited to announce that the Call for Papers/Proposals/Presentations for the [Transparency.dev Summit 2025](https://transparency.dev/summit2025/) is now open!

Earlier this year we [announced](https://blog.transparency.dev/announcing-transparencydev-summit-2025) the second annual Transparency.dev Summit, to be hosted by [Glasklar Teknik](https://www.glasklarteknik.se/) on 20th-22nd October 2025 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Led by Rasmus Dahlberg and Martin Hutchinson, this yearâ€™s program committee would like to welcome you to submit proposals for talks and presentations for the summit.

ðŸ‘‰ [Submit your proposal here](https://forms.gle/qtftQgbd3wmfqLkY6)

If you have a talk, presentation or idea you'd like to share at the summit, we'd love to hear it. Submissions are welcomed from first-time speakers, well established members of the transparency community, and everyone in between!

The official deadline is August 31st, but decisions will be being made and presentation proposals will be being accepted as they come in, so submit ideas sooner rather than later. We'd hate for the event to miss out on a brilliant topic because the schedule is already full!

Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
