We‚Äôre excited to announce the 2nd annual Transparency.dev Summit - a 2.5 day gathering of implementers, operators, and clients of real-world transparency systems.

**üóì** Save the Date: **October 20‚Äì22, 2025**

**üìç Gothenburg, Sweden**

**üè† Hosted by** [**Glasklar Teknik**](https://www.glasklarteknik.se)

The [inaugural](https://transparency.dev/summit2024/) [Transparency.dev](http://Transparency.dev) [Summit](https://transparency.dev/summit2024/) held in October 2024 was a huge success - bringing together over 50 attendees to drive the future direction of transparency ecosystems. Hosted by Google‚Äôs TrustFabric team in London UK, the [summit sparked insightful discussions and strong community momentum](https://blog.transparency.dev/transparencydev-summit-recap). Now, the hosting baton passes to another key community member: Glasklar Teknik, who will welcome us to Gothenburg, Sweden for the next chapter.

This year, we‚Äôre diving deeper into the infrastructure, operations, and future of transparency. Whether you‚Äôre running a transparency log, building new transparency ecosystems, or simply interested in learning more about how transparency builds trust for any digital domain, this summit is for you.

This year‚Äôs program committee will be led by Rasmus Dahlberg and Martin Hutchinson, helping shape the content and flow of the summit.

## Certificate Transparency (CT) Day

Certificate Transparency is a cornerstone of the conference. The CT community is undergoing [a major evolution towards tiled logs](https://blog.transparency.dev/what-2025-holds-for-certificate-transparency-and-the-transparencydev-ecosystem) to enhance the robustness of the ecosystem. Transparency.dev summit will feature a **dedicated CT day** with emphasis on:

* Adopting static CT logs for transformative benefits to the ecosystem
    
* Learning about real world challenges faced by log operators and browsers
    
* Tools and monitor solutions that help digest CT logs
    
* Post-Quantum Readiness - how to evolve for a PQ world
    

## Central Pillars of the Summit

In addition to CT, the summit will be structured around the three following pillars:

* **Applications of Transparency** - We're excited to have talks on existing and emerging use-cases:
    
    * **Binary Transparency** - This is a broad umbrella where we focus on 2 aspects:
        
        * Signature transparency logs such as Sigsum and Sigstore.
            
        * Package index logs such as GoSumDB.
            
    * **Key Transparency** - E.g., discussion of production deployments and open challenges.
        
    * **Other uses** - Please do not feel limited if your application's umbrella is not listed here.
        
* **Core Transparency Technology** - Verifiable data structures are at the core of all transparency applications. Implementations of verifiable logs, maps, and adjacent technologies such as witnesses, verifiers, and monitors are for example in scope.
    
* **Transparency Future Roadmap** - What‚Äôs next for transparency? We‚Äôll explore the roadmap ahead for various transparency technologies and standards.
