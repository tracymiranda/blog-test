Join us for the [Transparency.dev Summit](https://transparency.dev/summit/), a 3-day conference for implementers, operators, and users of real world transparency systems. The event takes place on October 9 to 11, 2024 in London, UK.

Certificate Transparency, now in its 11th year, has led the way making the issuance of website certificates transparent and verifiable.  Transparency technology has been adopted in various other domains including software supply chains, firmware transparency and binary transparency. Transparency technology continues to evolve to be easier to use and maintain as well as work in multiple use-cases. The evolution and adoption of transparency technologies reflects a growing emphasis on accountability and trust in our digital ecosystems.

The Transparency.dev Summit aims to bring together implementers, operators, and clients of real world transparency systems in order to meet peers, share best practices, and learn about the latest developments in the community. In addition to general transparency topics, the event will also feature dedicated sessions for the Certificate Transparency community.

Attendees will have the opportunity to learn more about transparency systems at scale and the latest developments in the transparency ecosystem. Some central themes of the conference will be:

* Witnessing: A key goal for transparency is to have a cross-ecosystem witness network that can provide protection to prevent split-view attacks. Talks here will examine the latest developments in the witness network and related technologies.
    
* Certificate Transparency: This will highlight lessons learned from log operators, especially those that can be applied to newer logs and ecosystems looking to emulate the success CT has achieved for over 10 years.
    
* Key Transparency: This emerging space aims to solve the problem of key discovery for providers of end-to-end encryption services.
    
* Binary Transparency: This is a wide umbrella term for bringing enhanced security to language ecosystems e.g. with Sigstore to firmware transparency and more
    
* Transparency futures: learn about the new and recent evolutions in transparency technologies that we can look forward to that make logs easier to run and maintain.
    

Some of the Trust Fabric team who initiated the conference share their thoughts about the event:

“*Transparency.dev Summit, dedicated to real-world transparency systems, is the first event of its kind. After much anticipation, the perfect conditions and growing interest in transparency technologies have come together to make this event a reality. We’re eager to gather the entire community, to connect, share, and see what incredible things we can achieve together.*” - Al Cutter, [recent Levchin Prize Winner](https://blog.transparency.dev/certificate-transparency-wins-the-levchin-prize).

“*I’m looking forward to seeing everyone and having meaningful conversations about transparency technology, continuing where we left off at CATS. I’m also excited to meet new faces and explore fresh ideas together!*” - Martin Hutchinson

“*I hope that I can go!*” - Jay Hou
