The [v1.2.0](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/releases/tag/v1.2.0)[/v.1.2](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/releases/tag/v1.2.0)[.1](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/releases/tag/v1.2.1) [are re](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/releases/tag/v1.2.1)leased in [google/certificate-transparency-go](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go)[. The highlight is **CTFE Storage Sa**](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go)**ving: Extra Data Issuance Chain Deduplication**, which reduces CT/Trillian database storage by deduplication of the entire issuance chain (intermediate certificate(s) and root certificate) that is currently stored in the Trillian merkle tree leaf ExtraData field. Storage cost should be reduced by at least *33%* for new CT logs with this feature enabled.Â (edited)
